","The leadership is eager and willing to do what it takes. ","Leadership is unfamiliar with remote learning. However, really trying to navigate what appropriateness looks like for 4yr olds in a remote setting. This is only a ""barrier"" because I'm not sure that BPS is thinking along the same lines of what is developmentally appropriate for 4yr olds in their guidelines.
